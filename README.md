# PraatScripts

This folder contains some scripts for Praat, developed at University of GÃ¶ttingen
in the Typology classes under the supervision of Prof. Stavros Skopeteas

* F0 over Time: given a sound file and a homonymous Textgrid this script extracts the values of the first 5 formants and of the pitch 
for intervals of a given length. The length of the intervals, number of formants, and many other parameters can be changed thanks to a 
simple form, which appears at the program start. All the results are saved into a .txt file.

* semitones_pictures: this scripts selects each annotation in a given tier of a TextGrid file and plots the pitch in semitones, the annotation text and the sound-wave together. The pictures are then saved in a directory and can be inserted used as illustrations in papers or essays.

Feel free to copy and use these scripts, if you need them.
